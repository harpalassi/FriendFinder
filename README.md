# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a full-stack app that lets the user answer a question survey and responds with the most compatible match based on their answers.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

Please clone and download this folder to your hard disk. You will then navigate to the folder and run `npm install` or `yarn`. This will install both `express` and `body-parser` dependencies.

Update the `PORT` settings in `express` if necessary, and type `node server` to get your personal server running. Open your favorite browser and visit `localhost:xxxx` in your browser where `xxxx` will be your port number. 

## Functionality

This app uses `node.js`, `jQuery` and `express` to create the full client and server experience. On the survey, please enter your name, a link to your photo image, and complete all 10 questions. After clicking `submit`, a modal will appear with your match!
